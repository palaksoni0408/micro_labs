Based on the conversation history and current message, assess the triage level and provide recommendations.

Respond ONLY in JSON format with the following structure:

{
  "triage_level": "EMERGENCY|URGENT|SELF_CARE|FOLLOW_UP",
  "escalate": true|false,
  "summary": "Brief summary of the situation",
  "recommended_next_steps": [
    "Step 1",
    "Step 2",
    "Step 3"
  ],
  "next_question": "Next question to ask the user (if conversation not complete, otherwise null)"
}

TRIAGE LEVEL GUIDELINES:

EMERGENCY: Red flag symptoms present, requires immediate emergency care
URGENT: High fever (>103°F), persistent symptoms, or concerning factors - see doctor soon
SELF_CARE: Mild symptoms, low-grade fever - can be managed at home with monitoring
FOLLOW_UP: Symptoms that should be monitored and may require follow-up with healthcare provider

CONSIDER THESE FACTORS:
- Temperature level (high fever = more urgent)
- Duration of symptoms (longer = more concerning)
- Age group (infants and seniors need more attention)
- Associated symptoms (breathing issues, chest pain, etc. = more urgent)
- Overall severity of symptoms

Always prioritize safety - when in doubt, recommend consulting a healthcare provider.
